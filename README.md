# Cosmology
What is our universe made of?

This work is about the principal compounds of our universe. We use the data obtained of Supernovas Ia such as lumiosity, distance (redshift)...

We analyza that data and determine the cosmological parameters (matter density, state equation for DM), and finally compare then so we can set which of our models has the best fit, and see the compounds of our universe.

In particular, we stutudied 3 models: \lambdaCDM, Einstein-de Sitter, and \omegaCDM.
